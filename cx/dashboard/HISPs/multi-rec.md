Since the launch of the CSAT on May 14 (thru June 30), we received 13,606 responses and have seen an overall trend of positive feedback. We have seen the most positive comments coming from customers researching a future trip, purchasing an annual pass, and modifying/cancelling a reservation. The team has also identified measurable goals to improve CSAT of RV and tent campers by identifying options to make maps more effective in making a reservation (such as illustrating locations in relation to other amenities and site features), increase images on facility pages to show various features of the locations, and streamline ability to discover availability of a secondary site after booking an initial site.
