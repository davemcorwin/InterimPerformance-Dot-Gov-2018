## Operational Data

### Education Call Center

The Education Call Center (ECC) delivers benefits and services to Veterans across the entire Nation and foreign countries. VBA is planning to continue to improve the ECC, located in Muskogee, Oklahoma, by providing an updated National training plan for agents and focusing on first call resolution.  Agents are also able to address all hardship related issues at point-of-call, which allows these claims to be processed within 24 hours and payment to be issued within three to five business days.

### National Call Center

VBA continues to modernize its National Call Center (NCC) model at all 8 sites (Columbia, SC; Cleveland, OH; Nashville, TN; Philadelphia, PA; Phoenix, AZ; Salt Lake City, UT; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and St. Louis, MO) to provide multiple access channels and increased point-of-interaction resolution options. The multi- channel model provides traditional and interactive care including live phone agents, e-mail, and live chat. Enhancements are expected to eliminate the need for Veterans to submit written forms and information and ensure that dependency-related issues are processed in the most efficient and effective manner possible.
