## Operational Data

### Q2 - Education Call Center

### Q2 - National Call Center

VBA continues to modernize its National Call Center (NCC) model at all 8 sites (Columbia, SC; Cleveland, OH; Nashville, TN; Philadelphia, PA; Phoenix, AZ; Salt Lake City, UT; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and St. Louis, MO) to provide multiple access channels and increased point-of-interaction resolution options. The multi- channel model provides traditional and interactive care including live phone agents, e-mail, and live chat. Enhancements are expected to eliminate the need for Veterans to submit written forms and information and ensure that dependency-related issues are processed in the most efficient and effective manner possible.
