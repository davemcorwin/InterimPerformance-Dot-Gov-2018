    <h2 style="color:#046b99;">Mission</h2>
    <p>The mission of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is to enhance the health and well-being of all Americans, by providing for effective health and human services and by fostering sound, sustained advances in the sciences underlying medicine, public health, and social services.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#046b99;">Overview</h2>
    <p>HHS is the U.S. government&rsquo;s principal agency for protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services, especially for those who are least able to help themselves. HHS accomplishes its mission through programs and initiatives that cover a wide spectrum of activities, serving and protecting Americans at every stage of life, from conception. HHS is responsible for almost a quarter of all federal outlays and administers more grant dollars than all other federal agencies combined.</p>
<p>Eleven operating divisions (OpDivs), including eight agencies in the U.S. Public Health Service and three human services agencies, administer HHS&rsquo;s programs. While HHS is a domestic agency working to protect and promote the health and well-being of the American people, the interconnectedness of our world requires that HHS engage globally to fulfill its mission. In addition, staff divisions (StaffDivs) provide leadership, direction, and policy guidance to the Department.</p>
