description: Developed a ground-based detect and avoid capability, allowing remote Unmanned Aircraft Systems operators to detect and avoid other aircraft. As a result, this new capability provides a safety level equivalent to a pilot operating under visual or instrument flight rules and a 90-95% probability of detecting other aircraft, well above the 80 percent requirement for terminal radar sources.
