#***********************FLOATING BOX SECTION*****************************

#***********************ACCORDION SECTION*****************************
statement: "Every CFO Act agency will successfully achieve at least two transformational program goals over the coming year through well-managed major acquisitions supporting a transformative critical or high-risk mission priority." #first accordion text

challenge: "Major acquisitions—which vary in size by agency but often exceed $50 million—account for approximately one-third of annual Federal spend on contacts. These large contracts frequently support projects meant to transform areas of critical need. Yet major acquisitions often fail to achieve their goals because many Federal managers lack the program management and acquisition skills required to successfully manage and integrate large and complex acquisitions into their projects. These shortcomings are compounded by complex acquisition rules that reward compliance over creativity and results." #second accordion text

opportunity: "Agencies and their contractors will successfully meet taxpayer expectations and performance goals on key transformational projects across the Government—from upgrading hospitals to better meet veterans needs to integrating technology into conducting a modern and efficient census to achieving IT modernization needs for a 21st century Government.
