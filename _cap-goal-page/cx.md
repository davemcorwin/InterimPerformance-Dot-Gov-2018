#***********************FLOATING BOX SECTION*****************************

#***********************ACCORDION SECTION*****************************
statement-bullets: "This goal will:"

bullet-1: "Transform the customer experience by improving the usability and reliability of our Federal Government’s most critical digital services;"

bullet-2: "Create measurable improvements in customer satisfaction by using the principles and practices proven by leading private sector organizations;"

bullet-3: "Increase trust in the Federal Government by improving the experience citizens and businesses have with Federal services whether online, in-person, or via phone;"

bullet-4: "Leverage technology to break down barriers and increase communication between Federal agencies and the citizens they serve." #first accordion text

challenge: "Whether seeking a loan, Social Security benefits, veterans benefits, or other services provided by the Federal Government, individuals and businesses expect Government customer services to be efficient and intuitive, just like services from leading private-sector organizations. Yet the 2016 American Consumer Satisfaction Index and the 2017 Forrester Federal Customer Experience Index show that, on average, Government services lag nine percentage points behind the private sector." #second accordion text

opportunity: "A modern, streamlined and responsive customer experience means:  raising government-wide customer experience to the average of the private sector service industry, as measured by external organizations; developing indicators for high-impact Federal programs to monitor progress towards excellent customer experience and mature digital services; providing the structure and resources to ensure customer experience is a focal point for agency leadership; and examples of programs where improved customer service will impact millions of Americans include Federal Student Aid, Airport Security Screening, National Parks, Veterans Health Care, Passport Services, Emergency and Disaster Relief, and Medicare." #third accordion text
