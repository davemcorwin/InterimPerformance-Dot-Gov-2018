#***********************FLOATING BOX SECTION*****************************

#***********************ACCORDION SECTION*****************************
statement: "This goal will:   eliminate low-value, unnecessary, and outdated policies and requirements issued by central management agencies like the Office of Management and Budget, the Office of Personnel Management, and the General Services Administration; develop a process to assess and minimize the burden of such guidance on Federal agencies; create incentives for Federal agencies to regularly review and streamline their own administrative requirements that impose burdens on their bureaus and programs; and reduce burden through tools like integrated IT and automation software." #first accordion text

challenge: "Too often, requirements persist over time despite changes to the circumstances they were intended to address. Hundreds of burdensome rules and requirements have built up over decades, forcing Federal agencies to devote valuable resources to compliance that is no longer meaningful. Time, energy, and dollars spent complying with outdated, redundant, and unnecessary requirements can be better spent on accomplishing mission outcomes." #second accordion text

opportunity: "A Federal Government that shifts time, effort, and funding from burdensome requirements to high value work will:   improve the return on investment of central-management guidance to Federal agencies; reduce compliance requirements for Federal agencies; work with Congress to eliminate outdated legislative reporting requirements for Federal agencies; and reduce unnecessary costs and compliance requirements within individual agencies.
