#***********************ACCORDION SECTION*****************************
statement: "This goal will:   reduce the amount of cash lost to the taxpayer through incorrect payments; clarify and streamline reporting and compliance requirements to focus on actions that make a difference; and partner with states to address improper payments in programs that they administer using Federal funds." #first accordion text

challenge: While all improper payments can compromise citizensâ€™ trust in Government, only a portion stem from fraud or lead to actual loss of taxpayer dollars. In addition to the incorrect payments themselves, improper payments also impose costs associated with fixing mistakes and recovering funds. Historically, the Federal Government has focused on improper payments broadly, including process errors that do not affect money paid, rather than strategically targeting monetary loss to taxpayers." #second accordion text

opportunity: "The Federal Government will:  reduce the annual amount of cash lost to the taxpayer; reduce burden on agencies to help focus their efforts strategically; and increase collaboration with states to further reduce cash lost. " #third accordion text
