    <h2>Details on How to Submit Your Solutions Across Each Phase Are Provided Below:</h2>
    <p>The competition will run through three phases. In the first, Solvers will be evaluated on their proposal (including any proposal to scale or grow existing initiatives) to deliver a relevant solution to a PMA-related challenge. The second phase will evaluate invited semi-finalists to share a more in-depth project plan and how this could be executed, as well as how this project supports a longer-term GEAR Center vision. In the third phase, finalists will be invited to present their proposals to a panel of Federal executives through 60-minute virtual meetings. </p>
    <p>In both phases requiring documents, entries must consist of PDF files with font size no smaller than 11-point Arial. All submissions must be in English. The participants must not use GSA’s or OMB’s logos or official seals in the submissions and must not otherwise give an appearance of Federal government endorsement.</p>
    <h3>Phase I: Project Proposal, Opens May 2nd – Deadline to Submit by May 24th at 5:00 PM EST</h3>
    <p>Solvers submit a no more than two-page proposal (inclusive of any visual representations or graphics), plus the cover sheet specified below, providing the following information:</p>
    <p>Problem Statement: Describe the PMA-related challenge(s) that your project tackles and any relevant background information. Address the impact and innovation potential of your GEAR Center solution given the status quo.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Project Summary: What will your project do over a one year period? How does this align to the vision of the GEAR Center (as described on pp 112-114 of the PDF, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.performance.gov/GovReform/Reform-and-Reorg-Plan-Final.pdf">Delivering Government Solutions in the 21st Century: Reform Plan and Reorganization Recommendations</a>?</li>
      <li>Anticipated Project Results: How can success be measured after one year? How can you use existing administrative data rather than new data collections? Who will ultimately benefit?  </li>
      <li>Ideal Team to Implement the Proposal: Describe the core team and partners or types of partners that would make for a successful project bringing diversity of industry, affiliation, geography, etc. (important: please write this in a way such that we can redact any organizational names for review).</li>
      <li>Resource Requirements: Describe what might be needed to implement your GEAR Center proposal (resources, stakeholder buy-in, other requirements, etc.). Address the feasibility of your idea. Note that the solution must be able to be delivered within current Federal operations and existing relationships - this award does not enable new Federal authorities or privileged access. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>During Phase I review process, the concept paper will be redacted for both applicant and any specific organizational partner names referenced (versus broader categories of organizational partners), and reviewed by Federal evaluators screened to avoid conflicts of interest.</p>
