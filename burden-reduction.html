As part of PMA Cross Agency Priority (CAP) Goal 6, Shifting from Low-Value to High-Value Work, agencies are shifting resources from outdated and redundant requirements and processes to accomplishing mission outcomes and are delivering efficient and effective results.</p>

      <p>This update includes more than 100 initiatives reported by the major 24 Federal agencies. These initiatives include more than 50 focused on process improvement and standardization, approximately 30 using robotics process automation (RPA), artificial intelligence (AI), and/or other innovative software, and nearly 20 focused on the digitalization of process within an agency.</p>

      <p>Collectively, this represents billions of dollars in realized and anticipated savings and hundreds of thousands of Full-Time Employee (FTE) hours shifted to higher-value work. The agency updates contained in this report summarize activities from the start of the new Administration to March 31, 2019 and as agencies move towards a leaner government for the American People.</p>

Through the RFI process alone, HHS received over 3,000 mentions of burden which resulted in over 1,000 distinct  burden topics to consider. As of February 2019, HHS resolved or is actively addressing over 80 percent of the actionable RFI burden topics. Through regulatory changes alone, HHS estimates a savings to the medical community of at least $5.7 billion and at least 40 million hours through 2021.</p>

These actions resulted in	an estimated $7.5 million in direct savings to OSHA through the elimination of costs associated with maintaining and enforcing these regulations. The impact of this initiative is $25.5 million in reduction of federal reporting burden on the regulated community.</p>
