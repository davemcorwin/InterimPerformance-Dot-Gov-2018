The importance of safe and effective generic drugs touches nearly every American household. Generic drugs embody the public health goals of quality, accessibility, affordability, and equity. They are a vital component of reducing health care costs, a fundamental goal of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Administration. Most importantly, generics make it possible for millions of Americans to access essential medications.

**Dr. Kathleen Uhl** pioneered the transformation of generic drug regulation, improving availability and acceptance of generics that have the same high quality as brand-name counterparts. During her six years as Director of the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Office of Generic Drugs, Dr. Uhl led dramatic improvements in the generic drug review process. She and her highly dedicated and talented staff integrated rigorous cutting-edge science, increased safety surveillance, and incorporated the expertise of clinicians and patients. Within three years of Dr. Uhl’s appointment, FDA **increased approvals of high-quality generics from 10 to 85-90 per month and resolved a backlog of over 5,000 applications for generic drug approvals**, all while maintaining FDA’s stringent criteria for quality and equivalence with brand-name products. In fiscal year 2017, FDA approved **971** generic drug applications of which **19 percent** were for first generics, paving the way to make these products more affordable for patients.
