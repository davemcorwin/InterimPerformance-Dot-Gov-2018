This approach will eliminate redundancies, increase efficiency, and deliver more value and savings from Federal acquisition programs. By the end of FY 2020, the Government will achieve $18 billion in savings for taxpayers by applying category management principles—or smart decision-making where agencies buy the same kinds of goods and services through best value contract solutions—to 60% of common spend. In addition, the Government will reduce duplicative contracts by 50,000, potentially reducing administrative costs by hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>' +
