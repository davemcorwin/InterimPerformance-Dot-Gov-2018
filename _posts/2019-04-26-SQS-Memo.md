**Administration Issues New Memo and Sharing Quality Services Strategy to Improve Government Efficiency**

**Washington** – Today, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a memorandum announcing the Administration’s updated approach to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of government operations through adopting shared services. The memorandum titled “Centralized Mission Support Capabilities for the Federal Government” helps eliminate duplicative efforts, consolidate fragmented processes, and replace antiquated technology in order to deliver more value to American taxpayers. As a key initiative laid out in the President’s Management Agenda, this new strategy also designates management leads in federal agencies to identify ways to use modern solutions to help improve services, such as payroll functions, for a more effective and efficient government.

“The memo establishes the new model for identifying, planning and operating government-wide shared services,” said Suzette Kent, Federal CIO. “The memo and supporting website identify functions targeted for standardization, provides structural directives for managing delivery of mission-support services, and outlines how the federal government will plan for and deliver improved business support services, maintain modern solutions, and make services more affordable for agencies.”

“As co-leaders of the cross-agency priority goal for sharing quality services, the U.S. General Services Administration and OMB have worked very closely and collaboratively over the past year to create a framework for implementing government-wide shared services,” said U.S. General Services Administrator Emily Murphy. “GSA is excited to continue the administration’s focus on shared services, both in our leadership role and as one of the initial agencies selected to implement this strategy. GSA will continue to embrace innovative solutions, like NewPay, to modernize and improve federal payroll management and other HR transaction services.”
