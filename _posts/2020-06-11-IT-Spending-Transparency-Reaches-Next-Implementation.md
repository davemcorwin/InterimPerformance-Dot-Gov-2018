*In 2017, the Federal Government began efforts to track funds and create transparency on resources spent on Information Technology (IT) through the implementation of Technology Business Management (TBM), a framework used to measure the value of their IT investments. Under the umbrella of the [President’s Management Agenda](https://www.performance.gov/PMA/PMA.html), the associated Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goal -- [IT Spending Transparency](https://www.performance.gov/PMA/PMA.html) -- had a goal to adopt TBM government-wide by Fiscal Year 2022.*

*This post provides a brief summary of the progress of* **IT Spending Transparency/TBM** *implementation across the government and an update on what’s next.* 
----------
Information technology is foundational to every Federal Government function and is a critical component in the delivery of services to citizens. In 2018, the [President’s Management Agenda](https://www.performance.gov/PMA/PMA.html) formalized [IT Spending Transparency](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/tbm/) as a CAP Goal with the intent to develop a government-wide classification system to categorize IT data that enables them to better understand how money is spent on IT.

**IT Spending Transparency Efforts Across Government**

The development of a government-wide classification system to categorize IT data is no easy task, but for agencies that have committed resources to better understand IT spending, the outcomes have been well worth the investment. Most notably, research conducted by the [Professional Resources Council](https://www.pscouncil.org/) has shown that the implementation of a standard cross-agency framework for understanding IT spending is having a "stabilizing effect" on civilian IT spending. In addition, agencies are embracing lessons they’ve learned from the private sector when it comes to IT, making more decisions through the use of business cases to justify any technology spending.

*“A guiding principle of GSA’s strategy is to demonstrate strong stewardship of every taxpayer dollar spent on technology. To be a good steward, it’s important to leverage what you already have and then determine what you still need.”- David Shive, Chief Information Officer, General Services Administration”*

As the government’s chosen framework and through the [Federal Technology Investment Management Community of Practice](https://www.cio.gov/about/members-and-leadership/ftim-cop/), agencies have leveraged TBM knowledge and best practices as a standard way to categorize IT costs, technologies, resources, applications, and services. For example:

**The Small Business Administration** (SBA) adopted the TBM framework in 2018. To create consistent standards for IT spending, the CIO’s office first spent time defining the core functions and services that SBA provides to customers. As a result, they created a model that enabled them to create a TBM data classification system. Long term, SBA’s goal is to demonstrate the value of IT purchasing to make better management decisions and create a model around which all IT investments are planned and charged.

**The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s** (FBI) goal is to identify gaps and duplication of IT services, enabling them to prioritize mission functions. So far, the FBI has collected and mapped IT spending data in a way that allows leaders to discuss investment opportunities and risk simultaneously. This level of insight has created the opportunity for leaders to make strategic management decisions that support specific FBI’s missions and has enhanced agency-wide communication about IT priorities.

**The Future of IT Spending Transparency & Next Steps**

The energy across the Federal Government to better understand IT spending and investments will only increase over time. The TBM framework will continue to be used as a strategy to achieve IT Spending Transparency and should continue to drive innovation and business transformation, improve services to citizens, add cost transparency, and increase accountability to taxpayers.  

To ensure timely progress is made towards this goal, the IT Spending Transparency CAP Goal will be repositioned under the existing CAP Goals: [Category Management](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/category-management/), [IT Modernization](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/it-mod/), and [Data, Accountability, and Transparency](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/leveragingdata/). This realignment will improve existing processes for IT budgeting and procurement, providing more visibility and traceability. TBM Subject Matter Experts will continue to collaborate across CAP Goals and communities of practices to ensure compliance under the [Capital Planning and Investment Control](https://www.cio.gov/policies-and-priorities/cpic/) process and the [Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act](https://www.congress.gov/113/plaws/publ291/PLAW-113publ291.pdf#page=148%5D), and to communicate changes.

GSA’s CIO David Shive reminds us that “a guiding principle of GSA’s strategy is to demonstrate
strong stewardship of every taxpayer dollar spent on technology. To be a good steward, it’s
important to leverage what you already have and then determine what you still need.” The
drive behind the IT Spending Transparency CAP Goal has been improvement in IT spending data
accountability and transparency, empowering agency executive-suite leadership from across
the enterprise to drive innovation, business transformation and mission value.

What does this mean for federal agencies? It 2018, the President’s Management Agenda
included IT Spending Transparency in its Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) goals, with a vision for
agencies to develop a classification system that would categorize IT data in a way that would
allow them to better understand their IT spend. At the time, several agencies chose to
implement Technology Business Management (TBM), one of many available schemas to classify
data.
Implementing an IT spending data schema is a complex undertaking. For agencies that have
invested resources in better understanding their IT costs, the outcomes have been well worth
the investments. TBM methodology and data standards measure IT costs and create a cross-
agency framework for understanding IT spending are having a stabilizing effect on civilian IT
spending.
Through the Federal Technology Investment Management (FTIM) Community of Practice (CoP),
a cross-agency group of 600 professionals which works to enhance IT spending transparency
across government, implementing agencies have been able to leverage knowledge about TBM
as a standard way to categorize information technology (IT) costs, technologies, resources,
applications, and services. Early TBM adopters have provided guidance to slower ones and are
collaborating on government specific schemas.
The Small Business Administration (SBA) was an early adopter of TBM in 2018, understanding
that it would take constant effort to gain visibility into the agency’s IT spending and to classify
and report it. Lacking consistent standards for IT spending, the CIO’s office decided that its time
should be spent defining the standard core functions that the agency must deliver to its
customers. In response, the SBA created a model that allowed them to create their own TBM
data classification. SBA’s longer-term vision is that its CIO will be able to demonstrate the value
of IT purchasing in order to make better management decisions; when business confidence is
high enough to pay for IT services, customers can understand the value of their investments.
Working toward establishing services levels, the agency’s goal is to be able to plan its whole
enterprise around these levels. SBA’s strategy is to make TBM a model around which all IT
investments are planned and charged.

The FBI’s vision for IT Transparency is entirely focused on its mission to protect and defend the
United States and to uphold the Constitution. Through this frame, the agency’s goal is to
identify gaps and duplication of its IT services so that it can focus on future opportunities and
investments, which will enable the agency to prioritize mission functions. The IT spending data
that FBI has collected is mapped in such a way that it allows leaders to have discussions not just
about assets in their IT asset portfolio but also about risk; this level of discussion allows leaders
to make strategic management decisions around future investments that support the FBI’s
mission. Additionally, the FBI credits TBM practices for enhancing agency-wide communication
about IT priorities 2 .
Each agency that has invested time, funding, and energy into using TBM (or another
commercially-available system of classifying data) has done so in order to focus on better
agency mission, vision, and stewardship. While agencies differ in their vision of how IT spending
transparency will advance their mission, each one has committed significant resources to
organizing and presenting data in order to make better management decisions.
The Federal Government’s focus on the importance of better understanding IT spending will
continue. Information about how that focus will align with the broader CAP goals will be
communicated in future messages. The broader message is this: efforts to implement IT
Spending Transparency should continue to drive innovation and business transformation,
improve services to citizens, add cost transparency, and increase accountability to taxpayers.
