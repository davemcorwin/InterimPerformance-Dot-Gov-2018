One year ago, the [President’s Management Agenda (PMA)](https://www.performance.gov/PMA/PMA.html) was released as a long-term vision for modernizing the Federal government. Today, we look back on a year of progress toward the ultimate goal of improving mission outcomes, service to the public, and stewardship of taxpayer dollars for the American people.

The PMA advances change through three drivers -- technology, data, and the workforce -- and recognizes that cross-agency collaboration is essential to finding solutions to government’s toughest problems. The PMA Anniversary Report highlights the agency successes and governmentwide momentum made over the past year in pursuit of a modern, more effective government.

Read about the accomplishments of the PMA so far here, and stay tuned to the [@Performancegov](https://twitter.com/PerformanceGov) Twitter account and our [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/35429296/admin/) as we feature the year’s progress.

*Note: The APG and CAP Goal progress updates on FY19 Q1 activities will occur in June and be combined with FY19 Q2 updates*.
