We’re excited to introduce the newest White House Leadership Development Program (WHLDP) cohort!

Last month, 13 federal employees from 10 agencies began a year-long journey to support multi-agency initiatives to advance good government solutions. This year’s cohort includes a broad cross-section of fellows with a rich set of experiences that will enable them to share best practices and expertise and solve problems collaboratively.
The fellows’ collective experiences will bring a unique flavor to the [President’s Management Agenda]({{ site.baseurl }}/PMA/PMA.html) and the [Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals]({{ site.baseurl }}/CAP/overview they are assigned to help lead.

This year, the fellows are working on nine CAP Goals and the [Government Effectiveness Advanced Research (GEAR) Center](https://www.performance.gov/GEARcenter/index.html), a public-private partnership to improve mission delivery, citizen services, and stewardship of public resources. Get to know the fellows below and read more about the program on the [WHLDP Overview Page](https://www.pic.gov/whldp/).
