The U.S. General Services Administration and the Office of Management and Budget are excited to launch the Government Effectiveness Advanced Research (GEAR) Center Challenge.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The GEAR Center Challenge is the next step toward establishing an innovation hub known as the <a href="https://www.performance.gov/GEARcenter/">GEAR Center</a> which will aim to tackle the toughest management challenges facing government. As outlined in the <a href="https://www.performance.gov/GovReform/Reform-and-Reorg-Plan-Final.pdf">*Delivering Government Solutions in the 21st Century Reform Plan*</a>, the GEAR Center will ultimately bring together experts across sectors and disciplines to take a creative, data-driven, and interdisciplinary approach to new possibilities in how citizens and government interact.

The challenge asks problem “solvers” to describe how they would implement a project, using the GEAR Center model, that creatively addresses one or more <a href="https://www.performance.gov/PMA/Presidents_Management_Agenda.pdf">*President's Management Agenda*</a>
-related challenges. This could include:
 - Transforming the way the federal workforce is recruited, developed, reskilled, or deployed.
 - Empowering external users to access and use government data for commercial and other public purposes.
 - Better connecting federal programs with a quantitative and qualitative understanding of the people they serve, and capturing the voice of the customer in order to continuously improve federal services.
 - Solvers can also suggest their own challenges and solutions to issues described in the President’s Management Agenda.

Proposals will be evaluated on their innovation, relevance, use of the partnership model, impact, and feasibility. Grand prize winners will receive $300,000 to carry out their projects and further explore the potential of the GEAR Center model.  

Phase I, the initial proposal phase, runs from May 2 through May 24. More information about phases and submission guidelines can be found on the <a href="https://challenge.gov/a/buzz/challenge/1023/ideas/top">Challenge.gov GEAR Center Challenge Page</a>.
