We’re excited to share that the 2019 Gears of Government Award recipients can now be viewed on our [Hall of Winners page]({{ site.baseurl }}/gearawards/winners/). Award recipients embody the values of mission, service, and stewardship, and their stories display the impact public servants are making across the government.

Throughout the year, Federal employees nominated individuals and teams across the Federal workforce whose performance and dedication deliver key outcomes for the American people, including mission results, customer service, and accountable stewardship. The individuals and teams recognized exemplify the hard work and innovation essential to achieving the [President’s vision for a modern, effective government]({{ site.baseurl }}/PMA/PMA.html). The Gears of Government Awards are designed to drive a culture of excellence and continuous improvement, which ultimately provides the federal workforce with tools and ideas to better serve the American people.

The Hall of Winners showcases award recipients by agency. Use the “Sort Winners by Agency” dropdown to navigate between agency winners or view all the winners at once using the “Show All Winners” button.
