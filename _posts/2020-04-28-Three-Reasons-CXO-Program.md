*The CXO Fellowship Program is accepting applications for the 2020-2021 cohort from May 1 through June 12, 2020. Learn more and apply at [cfo.gov/cxo-fellows/](https://cfo.gov/cxo-fellows/).*

While there are many professional development programs out there, few compare to the experiences offered through the [CXO Fellowship Program](https://cfo.gov/cxo-fellows/). To find out what the program looks like and how it impacts participants on a daily basis, we took a peek behind the curtain and got to see for ourselves just how transformative this program can be.

**1. Professional Development**

  Have you been looking for a “field trip” at work? The CXO Fellowship Program takes federal employees out of their day-to-day roles and exposes them to new topics, new people, and new agencies. Fellows visit different Washington, D.C.-area agencies to learn more about how that agency functions. While there, fellows attend sessions led by Federal Government leaders on a wide variety of topics, ranging from Agile project management to scripting an elevator pitch.

**2. Networking**

  While professional development is the main reason fellows apply for this program, we would be remiss if we didn’t highlight the incredible networking opportunity the program provides. Fellows are surrounded by 80 other highly-motivated Federal Government professionals who are all looking to learn new skills and take their careers to the next level. They share stories from their agencies and learn how problems are solved at others. Many of the fellows we talked to mentioned that they learned how other agencies solved problems and they were able to take these fresh ideas back to their teams and make an impact.

  When fellows meet together they are given the opportunity to work with others during their sessions as they practice new skills. Connections made in this program have led to new jobs, or new career path considerations for many fellows. Many of these connections last beyond the length of the year-long program and give fellows a network to keep in touch with when needed.

**3. Career Growth**

  Looking for a career boost? Between the lessons learned in the sessions and the connections made over the year-long program, the current and former fellows we interviewed agreed that the CXO Fellowship Program has helped expand and accelerate their career. In addition to gaining essential leadership skills, meeting with a cohort of federal employees from other agencies gives fellows a new perspective on their work and opens their eyes to new possibilities for their career.

  Many of the speakers in the program are leaders from across the Federal Government who inspire fellows to work their way up to leadership positions they may not have ever imagined for their career. In the program, fellows are able to pause their routine, take a step back, and rethink the direction of their future as a federal employee.
