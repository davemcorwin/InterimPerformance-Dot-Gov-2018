**Administration Recognizes Federal Employees' Contributions with Gears of Government President’s Awards**

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Washington** - Today, the Administration announces the winners of the Gears of Government President’s Award. Established as the Gears of Government Awards, this program recognizes the contributions of individuals and teams across the federal workforce who make a profound difference in the lives of the American people.

“Whether they are defending the homeland, inspecting our food, making scientific discoveries, or managing cyber risks, Federal employees underpin all the operations of our government and touch nearly every aspect of our lives,” said OMB’s Deputy Director for Management Margaret Weichert. “These awards recognize not just the front-line mission employees, but also those teams and individuals that are strengthening our country to be a more modern, effective government to better serve their fellow citizens.”
