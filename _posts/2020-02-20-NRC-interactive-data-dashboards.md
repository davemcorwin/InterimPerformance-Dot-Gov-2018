Today we released two interactive Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) dashboards as part of the Data Pilot Initiative to link program performance and budget data for federal agencies. This initiative is designed to provide meaningful analysis for agency decision makers and increase public transparency through enhanced data visualizations and displays.

*The Complete Performance Dashboard showing civilian nuclear power reactors and research and test reactors.*

**What We Did**

Our team worked closely with NRC and the Department of Treasury’s [USASpending.gov](https://www.usaspending.gov/) team to combine large NRC performance and spending data sets. The work resulted in two dashboards:
* *Complete Performance Dashboard*
* *Budget Analysis Dashboard*

NRC’s *Complete Performance Dashboard* features the data hierarchy found in their Congressional Justification (CJ) and can be broken down by business lines and product line with accompanying location and facility data where applicable. The *Budget Analysis Dashboard* features the hierarchy reported to [USASpending.gov](https://www.usaspending.gov/) and can be filtered by object class and broken down quarterly.

**What We Found**

We attempted to combine these data sets and found that the reported NRC budget and program performance data located in the CJ is structured in a hierarchy (‘Program, Business Line, Product Line’) that does not align with how the agency reports spending data to [USASpending.gov](https://www.usaspending.gov/). These differences limited our ability to make direct linkages between the budget data available on [USASpending.gov](https://www.usaspending.gov/) and the performance indicators in the CJ. To work around this issue, we manually mapped NRC’s data with other publicly available data found on NRC.gov to generate the data dashboards.

**What’s Next**

The Pilot highlighted that before we can move forward, the data reporting hierarchy and structural changes need to be remedied. Despite this challenge, our team is already looking into potential solutions and is committed to helping enhance agency financial data reporting to improve decision making and public transparency.

To view NRC’s dashboards, visit [performance.gov/data](https://www.performance.gov/data/). You can find the performance and budget data featured in these dashboards in [NRC’s FY18 and FY19 Congressional Justification](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1802/ML18023B460.pdf) and on [USASpending.gov](https://www.usaspending.gov/).

*Over time, our team will work with additional agencies to bring you more key data sets in new and innovative ways. Let us know what kind of data visualizations you would like to see and provide feedback on our work so far:*
