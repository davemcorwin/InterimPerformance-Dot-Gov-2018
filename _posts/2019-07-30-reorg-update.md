In June 2018, the Administration issued Delivering Government Solutions in the 21st Century: Reform Plan and Reorganization Recommendations (Reform Plan) to build upon the President’s Management Agenda and fulfill the President’s direction in Executive Order (EO) 13781, “Comprehensive Plan for Reorganizing the Executive Branch”. The Reform Plan proposed bold reforms to address structural and organizational barriers to mission, service, and stewardship objectives.

One year later, agencies have made important progress on fundamental reorganization reform, collectively representing the most comprehensive attempt to modernize the structures of Government in recent decades.

**Over the past year:**
- Congress has taken action to consider at least 10 of the proposals, via discussions with Members
or staff, hearings, or legislation.
- The President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Budget included 18 of the reorganization proposals, either in whole or in part.
- Agencies are using existing authorities to implement more than 20 of the proposals.
