Administration Issues New Memo and Shared Services Strategy to Improve Government Efficiency
Washington – Today, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a memorandum announcing the Administration’s updated approach to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of government operations through adopting shared services. The memorandum titled “Centralized Mission Support Capabilities for the Federal Government,” helps eliminate duplicative efforts, consolidate fragmented work, and replace antiquated technology in order to deliver more value to American taxpayers. As a key initiative laid out in the President’s Management Agenda, this new strategy also designates management leads in federal agencies to identify ways to use modern solutions to help improve services, such as payroll functions, for a more effective and efficient government.  

“The memo makes clear what the federal government is standardizing, who is responsible for managing delivery of mission-support services, and how we as the federal government are delivering better, faster, more affordable services to agencies,” said Kent. “This new approach will move us towards modern solutions and services that enable the workforce to better serve the American taxpayer.”

“As co-leaders of the cross-agency priority goal for sharing quality services, the U.S. General Services Administration and OMB have worked very closely and collaboratively over the past year to create a framework for implementing governmentwide shared services,” said U.S. General Services Administrator Emily Murphy. “GSA is excited to continue the administration’s focus on shared services, both in our leadership role and as one of the initial agencies selected to implement this strategy. GSA will continue to embrace innovative solutions, like NewPay, to modernize and improve federal payroll management and other HR transaction services.”
