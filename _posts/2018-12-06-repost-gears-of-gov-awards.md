As public servants, we have a unique privilege to serve our country and the responsibility to ensure our fellow Americansâ€™ tax dollars produce results that enhance their lives.

Some federal employees have the honor of working face-to-face with the American people, like the firefighters who protect our communities from wildfire and the responders who provide food, clothing, and shelter in the aftermath of a natural disaster. Other federal employees who serve behind the scenes ensure the food we feed our families and the roads we drive on are safe. Many federal employees drive innovation and technology to produce better outcomes for Americans, like the scientists who use federal data to reduce the overprescription of opioids. Every day civil servants are working for you, your family, your community, and the nation.

All of these federal employees across the government play pivotal roles in achieving the President's vision for a modern, effective government. Hard-working and innovative federal employees should be recognized, which is why we launched the Gears of Government Awards.

The Gears of Government Awards recognize individuals and teams across the federal workforce whose performance and dedication deliver key outcomes for the American people, including mission results, customer service, and accountable stewardship. The Gears of Government Awards are designed to drive a culture of excellence and continuous improvement, which ultimately provides the federal workforce with tools and ideas to better serve the American people.

We look forward to sharing the stories of exceptional civil servants who are shaping a more modern, effective government and living the values of mission, service, and stewardship.
